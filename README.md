# NSLabel

NSLabel is a replica of [UILabel](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uilabel) for macOS. It is much more simple and lightweight than [NSTextField](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextfield), while retaining near pixel-perfect rendering and Auto Layout compatibility.

A fork of [lhecker/NSLabel](https://github.com/lhecker/NSLabel), written in Swift.

## Requirements

* Projects targeting macOS 10.9+
* Swift 4
